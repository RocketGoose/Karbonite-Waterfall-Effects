Karbonite Waterfall Effects
=============================

Karbonite Waterfall Effects adds Waterfall effets to the engines from the Karbonite mod. It contains a set of templates and engine configuration files. 

This mod uses some of the templates from Stock Waterfall Effects for the Karbonite LFO engines.
